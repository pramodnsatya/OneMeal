## 🍽️ One Meal 🌍  

One Meal is a **mobile application** 📱 designed to **combat food wastage** 🚫🍕 by connecting **food donors**, **NGOs**, and **volunteers** 🤝. Every year, approximately **1.3 billion tons of food** is wasted globally, while millions suffer from **hunger** 😞🍽️.  

✨ **How It Works:**  
🍛 **Donors** (restaurants, event organizers, individuals) can **donate surplus food** instead of wasting it.  
🏡 **NGOs** can browse and **request food** to distribute to those in need.  
🚴 **Volunteers** can **deliver food** to bridge the gap, making this platform truly **collaborative & unique**!  

💡 **Tech Stack:**  
🔹 Developed in **Android Studio** using **Java** ☕  
🔹 **Firebase** for seamless backend support 🔥  

🌱 Our goal is to build a **sustainable and efficient food donation network** to help reduce waste and **feed the hungry**! 🌎💚
